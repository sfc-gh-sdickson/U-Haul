/*
 * U-Haul Snowflake Intelligence Demo - Semantic Layer
 * 
 * This script creates semantic views and helper analytics for the Intelligence Agent.
 * These views provide business-friendly abstractions over the raw data and enable
 * natural language queries about U-Haul operations.
 * 
 * Views created:
 * - RENTAL_ANALYTICS: Comprehensive rental metrics and KPIs
 * - VEHICLE_PERFORMANCE: Vehicle utilization and performance metrics
 * - CUSTOMER_INSIGHTS: Customer behavior and segmentation
 * - FLEET_HEALTH: Vehicle maintenance and operational status
 * - REVENUE_ANALYSIS: Financial performance and trends
 * - UHAUL_SEMANTIC: Main semantic view for Intelligence Agent
 * 
 * Prerequisites: Run 00_setup.sql, 01_tables.sql, and 02_load_synthetic.sql first
